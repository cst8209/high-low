# High Low

## Objective
Create an interactive game where the player must guess the secret number between 1 and 10. The player makes guesses by invoking the `guess` function in the console. A response of **high** or **low** is given for each wrong guess. If the player guesses the number, the player wins. After 3 wrong guesses, the player loses. The player can play again by invoking the `start` function in the console.
